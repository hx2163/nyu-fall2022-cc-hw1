# Overview

Customer Service is a core service for a lot of businesses around the world and it is getting disrupted at the moment by Natural Language Processing-powered applications.
In this assignment you will implement a serverless, microservice-driven web application. Specifically, you will build a Dining Concierge chatbot that sends you restaurant suggestions given a set of preferences that you provide the chatbot with through conversation.


- **1. Build and deploy the frontend of the application**
- **2. Build the API for the application**
- **3. Build a Dining Concierge chat bot using Amazon Lex**
- **4. Integrate the Lex chatbot into your chatAPI**
- **5. Use the YelpAPI to collect 5,000+ random restaurants from Manhattan.**
- **6. Create an ElasticSearch instance using the AWS ElasticSearch Service.**
- **7. Build a suggestions module, that is decoupled from the Lex chatbot.**
